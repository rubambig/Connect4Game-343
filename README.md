# Connect4Game-343

A text based Connect-4 game with the aim to improve
proficiency in C pointers. 
The game features the abilities to save the current
game state and load previous games from the command 
line. Utilises a previous implementation of a
file_utils to perform the saves and loads. 

Additionally, user arguments are parsed using C's 
argp functionality. Structs, pointers, and 
multi-dimensional arrays are use extensively in the
game play.

Argument parsing code and guidance was provided by 
Professor Ira Woodring. Additional ideas for string
manipulation were obtained from StackOverflow.com. 

The project was developed as an integral part of the 
Structure of Programming Languages(CIS 343) class at 
Grand Valley State University.
